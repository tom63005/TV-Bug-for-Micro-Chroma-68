This is just the MC6800 assembly code from <br />
the bitsavers archive of the Micro-Chroma-68 <br />
It is called "TV-Bug" and was created in 1978 <br />
for experimenting with the Motorola MC6847 VDG. <br />
 <br />
I have tested it to compile using the "AS0.exe" <br />
from the simtel archive using DOSBOX. <br />
( Link is below, the tool is in the MotoASMS.ZIP <br />
of Simtel-MSDOS-Sep1996-CD2.iso , in directory: <br />
E:\DISC2\CROSSASM\MOTOASMS.ZIP ) <br />
